# Fraud\_Detection\_Lightgbm

Fraud detection on 6.3M transactions using LightGBM with SMOTE and feature engineering.

\# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions



\## Overview

This project detects fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning, particularly \*\*LightGBM\*\* with SMOTE for class imbalance. The dataset contains millions of transactions, but a \*\*sample dataset\*\* is included for demonstration.



\## Folder Structure

\- `data/sample\_fraud.csv` — small subset for testing

\- `notebooks/eda.ipynb` — exploratory data analysis

\- `src/fraud\_model.py` — model training and prediction scripts



\## Features

\- Handles class imbalance using \*\*SMOTE\*\*

\- Feature engineering around balance changes

\- ROC-AUC evaluation of fraud detection model



\## How to Run

1\. Clone the repo:

&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  git clone https://github.com/saaduddin142003-boop/Fraud\_Detection\_Lightgbm.git

&nbsp;  cd FRAUD\_DETECTION
